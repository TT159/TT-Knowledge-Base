## Background

Extracting event-argument structures is an important problem in natural language understanding. 
[[Event Argument Extraction (EAE) Task]]

It is about identifying entities participating in events and specifying their role (e.g., the giver, recipient, and thing given in a given event). 

Event triggers (i.e., words instantiating events) include both nouns (e.g., election, speech), and verbs (e.g., vote, talk).

event-argument structures are beneficial for applications such as news summarization and coreference. 


**coreference task**
[[NLP Concepts]]
**Coreference** 指的是：
> **文中两个或多个表达，指的是同一个实体（object/person/place/idea）**。
